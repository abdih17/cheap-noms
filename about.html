        <p class="aboutInfo">I am a mid-westerner at heart, but after moving here to Seattle in 2010, Seattle is slowly but surely growing on me. I am currently attending Code Fellows in hopes of becoming a full-stack web developer. I majored in Early Childhood and Elementary Education from the Teacher Preparation Program at Central Washington University. With my background of Education and the skills I will have gained from CF, I hope to combine both of my passions into one.</p>

        <p class="aboutInfo">I've spent most of my professional life in digital and internet marketing before I started coding. I hope to take the skills and knowledge I learn at Code Fellows and be able to contribute to projects that make an impact. When I'm not in front of a screen, I'm usually hanging out with my Shiba Inu, Roxy. #GoHawks!</p>

        <h3>Danny Becker</h3>
        <p class="aboutInfo">I am Seattle born and raised. I spent most of my childhood driving to Canada hundreds of times to play hockey. After high school, I received my bachelors degree in business with a focus on entrepreneurship from Washington State University. I went to work as a project manager, and quickly found that was not my ideal career path. I came to Code Fellows with the dream of learning how to code, and eventually creating my own start-up business one day. I am truly enjoying my experience so far, and am excited to see what the future holds for me.</p>
